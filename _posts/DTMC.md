Jack and Harry were lost over a vast farmland while on their balloon ride. 

When they spotted a bicyclist on trail going through the farmland below, they lowered their balloon and yelled, “Good day, sir! Could you tell us where we are?”

The bicyclist looked up and said, “Sure! You are in a balloon!”

Jack turned to Harry and said, “This guy must be a mathematician!”

“What makes you think so?” asked Harry.

“Well, his answer is correct, but totally useless!”
