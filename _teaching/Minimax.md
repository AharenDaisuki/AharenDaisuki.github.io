Abstract
======
In comparison to the previous assignment, the nature of Wolf-Eat-Sheep enables static evaluation of certain game states. Therefore, minimax algorithm is adopted in this assignment. 
In order to decrease the number of the nodes evaluated by minimax, alpha beta pruning is facilitated in the implementation of minimax algorithm. 
Besides, to significantly reduce the number of steps needed for one game, a Checkmate scheme is introduced to check whether there is a trivial move to win.
