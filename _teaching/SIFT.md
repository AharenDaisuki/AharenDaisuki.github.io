Abstract
======
In this project,  scale invariant feature transform (SIFT), local binary pattern (LBP) and color histogram 
is implemented to facilitate the instance search task and the experiment is mainly based on SIFT implementation. 
Due to the lack of training data with annotations and the device limit, it is rather challenging and time-consuming 
to prepare the training data set and to train a model from scratch. Therefore, CNN-based methods are not considered in this assignment.
