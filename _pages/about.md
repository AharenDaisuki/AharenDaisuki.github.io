LI Xiaoyang is currently studying for his bachelor's degree in [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/) 
at [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/), minoring in MA.

On behalf of ACM team of City University of Hong Kong, his team won bronze metal in the 46th ICPC Asia Regional Contest,
Jinan site 2021. It is certified that he achieved a place on the Dean's List in 2021/2022, 2022/2023 academic year for his outstanding academic performance. 
He worked for Programming Clinic at Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong in 2022, supervised by professor Kenneth Lee.

He then worked in [Theory Lab of Huawei, Hong Kong Research Center](https://www.hkstp.org/our-community/innovator-directory/company-details?company=huawei-tech-investment-co-limited) 
as research intern in control theory and optimization group from June 2022 to March 2023,
supervised by [Michael, ZHANG fan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XXfO9BYAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), senior researcher at Huawei technologies. His contribution mainly lies in the development of IO module, model presolve module 
and design of data structure for linear programming solver.

In 2023 summer, he interned in [RECSEM 2023](https://www.jics.utk.edu/recsem-reu/recsem23/projects#field1), working on the efficient implementation of 
attention algorithm in MagmaDNN framework, supervised by [Dr. Wong Kai Lam](https://mabe.utk.edu/people/kwai-l-wong/). 
He then was selected for the Reaching Out Award 2022/23 by Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, in the same year. 

In 2024, supervised by professor Rynson LAU, he finished his final year project titled [Deep learning model for camouflaged object detection](https://github.com/AharenDaisuki/Deep-learning-model-for-camouflaged-object-detection) and graduated from city University of Hong Kong. 
In the same year, he worked for Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong as full-time research assistant, participating in the project titled Integrating Virtual and Real-World Testing Environments for Autonomous Vehicles.

His research interest mainly lies in computer vision, natural language process, algorithm design and analysis, optimization theory.
